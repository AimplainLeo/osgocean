#summary Getting up and running

= Using the library =

== Dependencies ==

=== OpenSceneGraph ===

The main dependancy is of course the OpenSceneGraph libraries. osgOcean was built with with OSG2.8 in mind. The libraries can be downloaded here: 

<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads"> http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads </a>

=== FFT Calculation Library ===

osgOcean needs to be linked against an FFT library. You can choose either the FFTW or FFTSS library.

[http://www.fftw.org/ FFTW] is GPL, so linking osgOcean to it will make osgOcean GPL (and your application too if you link it to this version of osgOcean).

[http://www.ssisc.org/fftss/ FFTSS] is LGPL, so linking osgOcean to it means that osgOcean retains its LGPL license, and thus it can be used in conformance with the LGPL license.

You will need to specify the include directory and library file of your installed and compiled FFT library when building the project. Both offer precompiled binaries for Windows, though FFTW requires that you generate the import libraries before being able to use it (see [http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html]).

== Resources ==

The library requires access to the 'resource' directory to load the textures and shaders that decorate the ocean surface.

You can download the texture resources from the 'Downloads' tab or by clicking <a href="http://osgocean.googlecode.com/files/resources_textures.rar">here</a>

The path that is used within the library and example program is:

resources/textures/..<br>
resources/shader/..

You should make sure that the resource directory is either in the same directory as the DLL/EXE or setup a path variable.

They should also be placed in the resource directory before running the "INSTALL" project.
