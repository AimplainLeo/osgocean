#summary Getting up and running

= Using the library =

== Compiling ==

osgOcean 1.0 is a cross platform library. 

Use CMake version 2.6.3 or greater to generate native makefiles or workspaces for your chosen compiler environment.

<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">http://www.cmake.org/</a>

== Dependencies ==

=== OpenSceneGraph 2.8 ===

The main dependancy is of course the OpenSceneGraph libraries. osgOcean 1.0 was built with with OSG2.8 in mind. The libraries can be downloaded here: 

<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads"> http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads </a>

=== Fast Fourier Transform Library ===

osgOcean needs to be linked against a Fast Fourier Transform library. You can choose either the FFTW or FFTSS library.

<a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a> is GPL, so linking osgOcean to it will make osgOcean GPL (and your application too if you link it to this version of osgOcean).

<a href="http://www.ssisc.org/fftss/">FFTSS</a> is LGPL, so linking osgOcean to it means that osgOcean retains its LGPL license, and thus it can be used in conformance with the LGPL license.

You will need to specify the include directory and library file of your installed and compiled FFT library when building the project. FFTW offers precompiled binaries for Windows, though it requires that you generate the import libraries before being able to use it (see <a href="http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html">http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html</a>). FFTSS needs to be compiled, but it is painless as VC7 project files are provided in the win32 subdirectory of the source archive. You only need to compile the release version.

== Resources ==

Both the library and the example require a set of resource
files (models/textures) which can be downloaded from here:

<a href="http://osgocean.googlecode.com/files/osgOcean-Resources-1.0.rar">http://osgocean.googlecode.com/files/osgOcean-Resources-1.0.rar</a>

Once you've downloaded them, extract the 'Island' and 'Textures' 
folders into the resources directory found in the root of the
source code tree. The install project will copy the relevant
data files to the bin path like so:

%install_path%/bin/resources/

osgOcean uses the osgDB registry to find the resource files.
By default it adds the following paths to the registry:

Shader path:
resources/shaders/

Texture path:
resources/textures/

If you wish to move these resources you must update the data file path 
list within the registry yourself. This can be down from outside the 
library with the following code:

osgDB::FilePathList& pathList = osgDB::Registry::instance()->getDataFilePathList();
pathList.push_back( new_path );

== Bugs / Suggestions ==

Please add any bugs or suggestions you have to the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/osgocean/issues/list>issue tracker</a> and I'll try to address them.
