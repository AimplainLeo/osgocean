= Using the library =

== Dependencies ==

osgOcean needs to be linked against the FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) library. <br>

You may download it here:

<a href="http://www.fftw.org/">http://www.fftw.org/</a>

You will need to specify the include and lib directories when building the project with CMake.

== Resources ==

The library requires access to the 'resource' directory to load the textures and shaders that decorate the ocean surface.

The path that is used within the library and example program is:

resources/textures/..<br>
resources/shader/..

You should make sure that the resource directory is either in the same directory as the DLL/EXE or setup a path variable.
